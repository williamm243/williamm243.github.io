As part of personal studying and self improvement i saw it fit to learn about html and css and deploy my website online.


HTML(hypertext mark up language)

 The syntax for html was not a very hard nut to crack i took my time to learn htmls skills from websites like w3school mdn and you tube this were very usefull in my enlightnment about html 
 
 
CSS (cascading style sheets)

 css was also interesting part because it was styling and making my website look more beautiful which i found intriguing and more fun to study
